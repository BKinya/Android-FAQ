### What topics do should I learn before applying for my first Android job? 
For your first role, make sure you master the basics in Android. Some of the things to consider include:
- Working Kotlin Knowledge
- Layouts either using XML or Compose
- Navigation
- Android SDK and API version
- Storing data locally in an app
- Calling a rest API from an App
- Debugging

### What do Interviewers look for in An Android Dev?
  
- Technical strengths: Coding best practices, implementation of Android libraries, test cases coverage, version control(Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket) 
  
- Cultural fitness: Team collaboration, good communication, honest feedback, conflict resolution.

### Resources to learn Jetpack Compose

- [Jetpack Compose For Android Developers training resources](https://developer.android.com/courses/jetpack-compose/course), to get started with Jetpack Compose in Android. 
- [Practical Jetpack Compose, Joe Birch](https://practicaljetpackcompose.com) to learn how to build Android apps using Jetpack Compose
Compose projects
- [Jetpack Compose Internals, Jorge Castillo](https://jorgecastillo.dev/book/) to learn deeper compose topics and compose implementation under the hood. 
- [Jetpack Compose and internals cohort course, Jorge Castillo](https://jorgecastillo.dev/course/) 
- Check for [Jetpack Compose Newsletters](https://twitter.com/alexstyl/status/1662740985456263168?s=20) here. 

### Which Architecture should I use in my app?
There exist several architecture patterns: MVP, MVVM, MVI, Redux and much more. Architecture patterns are guidelines for building quality apps. They are not cut-on-stone rules. 

All best practices can be applied to any architecture pattern. 

Nonetheless, architecture patterns are different: how they are implemented, the learning curve etc.  

Before adopting an architecture into your app, make sure you first understand how it works. 

My two cents: 
For beginners, I'd recommend starting with MVVM. It has a gentle learning curve, adopted in several Android projects and has many resources online. 

For Jetpack Compose projects, I'd recommend an MVI kind of approach. This helps a lot with state handling. And you can implement MVI on top of MVVM. 

### Compose vs XML
Jetpack Compose is the recommended modern UI toolkit for developing native Android UI. With Jetpack Compose, you build the UI faster with less code and using intuitive Kotlin APIs. 

Do you have to know XML to learn to compose? No. For beginners, you could get started with Compose straight away. But XML knowledge is good to have. XML is still dominant in legacy projects. Maintaining such projects requires one to know about XML. 

I'd advise working on some projects using XML then jump to Compose. Knowledge about how Views/XML work will help you appreciate the progress in Android UI development and the benefits of using Jetpack Compose in developing UI.

### Java or Kotlin

Kotlin is the first-class language for Android development. New Android development tools and content such as Jetpack libraries and training content are designed in Kotlin. For instance, Jetpack Compose, compiler plugins support, and multiplatform projects. 

Therefore, if you're considering Android Development, I'd encourage learning Kotlin. 

Also, Kotlin is cross-platform. It can be used in Android development, server-side and Kotlin multi-platform. Check the docs for more: [Kotlin Docs](https://kotlinlang.org)

### What does an Android developer do on a normal basis?
Android developers design and develop apps for various Android devices: phones, tablets, smartwatches, TV, and cars. They debug and troubleshoot issues in the apps, maintain existing apps, create Android libraries and stay current with Android OS, android development updates. 

### What does an Android dev interview process entail, are there DSA or behavioral questions?
An Android interview process will vary from one company to another. But the most common parts you will encounter include: 
- Resume screening. 
- The recruiter, hiring manager call. This is typically not technical but covers your experience. 
- Technical Screening. Different companies choose different screening approaches. Some of the options include: 
    - Time boxed code  challenge. This includes likes of Hackerrank or leet code challenges, evaluted by an Engineer or automatically. 
    - Technical screening call with an Android Engineer. Android concepts are asked. You mighty be asked to pair program with the engineer to write code for a small problem. 
    - Take home assignment
- On-site interview. This is usually the last stage. It varies from company to company. Some of the activities here include
    - Coding. If you were given a take home assignment you migty be asked to expand the project to test how you respond to requirement changes. Others may ask general data structures questions
    - Mobile system design questions. You are asked to design a mobile app. This mostly focuses on the app architecture. 
    - Behavioral or hiring manager interview

Preparing for interviews makes all the difference difference. So prepareðŸ˜ƒ. 

### As a beginner, when do I know it's the right time for me to start applying for a job?
I do not think there is a specific time. You could start applying immediately after Campus, after completing a boot camp.

Nonetheless, prepare for the job search. Build apps to show what you are able to do. Have them on GitHub and/or publish them on Play Store.

### Mentorship and Communities
Mentorship is a learning relationship between an experienced person and someone who **wants to grow**. With a healthy mentoring relationship, both parties gain, not just the mentee[Growing as a Mobile Engineer](https://www.mobileatscale.com/growing.html).

Mentees. Do not ask, "Will you be my mentor?". If you ask the answer is probably no. So shift your thinking from "If I get a mentor, I'll excel" to "If I excel, I will get a mentor". Mentorship relationships start with a mutual connection -- and mentors often select protÃ©gÃ©s based on their performance and potential. [Lean In For Graduates](https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Graduates-Chapters-Including-Negotiate/dp/0385353677)

Start working on something. Start learning,  working on that project, writing that article etc. You'll find many people willing to guide you along the way. 

For instance, If you get stuck coz of a bug, reach out for help. There are numerous amazing developers in developer communities willing to help you. This is one of the ways to find mentors. 

And Join developer communities. To learn, to network.
