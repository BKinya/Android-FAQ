### How do I get my first Android Developer role?
- Have some well-documented projects on GitHub which has a Readme and at least one useful app on Playstore.
- Update your Linkedin profile with the projects you've worked on, relevant achievements,  volunteer experience, and any previous experiences like internships.

**Tips To increase your chances of landing a Job**
- Write about the technology you're looking to get a job in. In this, case Android. You'd write about an API you're recently learning about, a bug you solved etc. 
- Record a video tutorial showing how to do something in Android. 
- Contribute to open-source projects. Open-source projects give you an opportunity to learn practically,  practice your skills, and build your confidence.
- Build an app, while sharing the journey on social media. You'd also write an article about the journey or record a video and post it on YouTube.
- Speak at local meet-ups and conferences.

### What factors played a role in improving your Android development skills?
- Working on projects: work projects,  open source projects, pet projects, side projects. Some of Android open source projects: [Droidcon KE 2023 Android App](https://github.com/droidconKE/droidconKE2023Android), [UseHover/Stax](https://github.com/UseHover/Stax). 
- Reading other people's code. Check out [Android Dev Notes](https://twitter.com/androiddevnotes) on Twitter. They share great Android projects. 
- Reading Android and Kotlin documentation, as well as Android and Kotlin articles. 
- Reading Android and Kotlin books.

### Which Architecture should I use in my app?
There exist several architecture patterns: MVP, MVVM, MVI, Redux and much more. Architecture patterns are guidelines for building quality apps. They are not cut-on-stone rules. 

All best practices can be applied to any architecture pattern. 

Nonetheless, architecture patterns are different, how they are implemented, the learning curve etc.  

Before adopting an architecture into your app, I'd recommend you first understand how it works. 

My preference: 
For beginners, I'd recommend starting with MVVM. It has a gentle learning curve, adopted in several Android projects and has many resources online. 

For Jetpack Compose projects, I'd recommend an MVI kind of approach. This helps a lot when it comes to handling state. And you can implement MVI on top of MVVM. 



### Compose or XML

### Java or Kotlin

### GDE
