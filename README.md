### How do I get my first Android Developer role?(Can this be a paragraph? I hope)
- Have some well-documented projects on GitHub which has a Readme and at least one useful app on Playstore.
- Update your Linkedin profile with the projects you've worked on, relevant achievements,  volunteer experience, and any previous experiences like internships. 
- Keep your CV updated. You'd build one with LinkedIn Resume Builder
- Set your LinkedIn status to `Open to Network`. 
- Directly reach out to recruiters you know or have interacted with. 
- Company websites etc.

**Tips To increase your chances of landing a Job**
- Write about the technology you're looking to get a job in. In this, case Android. You'd write about an API you're recently learning about, a bug you solved etc. 
- Record a video tutorial showing how to do something in Android. 
- Contribute to open-source projects. Open-source projects give you an opportunity to learn practically,  practice your skills, and build your confidence.
- Build an app, while sharing the journey on social media. You'd also write an article about the journey or record a video and post it on YouTube.
- Speak at local meet-ups and conferences.

### What factors played a role in improving your Android development skills?
- Working on projects: work projects,  open source projects, pet projects, side projects. Some of Android open source projects: [Droidcon KE 2023 Android App](https://github.com/droidconKE/droidconKE2023Android), [UseHover/Stax](https://github.com/UseHover/Stax). 
- Reading other people's code. Check out [Android Dev Notes](https://twitter.com/androiddevnotes) on Twitter. They share great Android projects. 
- Reading Android and Kotlin documentation, as well as Android and Kotlin articles. 
- Reading Android and Kotlin books. 
- Writing Android articles, and recording Android video tutorials. They say one of the best ways to learn is by teaching others, the protégé effect.

### How'd I stay updated with the latest trends, tools, and libraries in the Android development ecosystem?
- Major conferences: Google I/O, Android Dev Summit, Kotlin Conf', Droidcon conferences across the world. Watch out for this. They sure will discuss related stuff.
- Follow top Android Developers on Twitter, and LinkedIn: <<<Add to the list... I have to put the ones who stand out for me>>> 
- Attend developer meetups. Android254 in Kenya. Meetups are a great place to learn and network
- Listen to Android Podcasts: Android Developers Backstage, [Fragmented Podcast](https://fragmentedpodcast.com)
- Subscribe to Android newsletters: Android Weekly, Kotlin weekly, effective android. 
- Subscribe  to Android Youtube channels: [Android Developers](https://www.youtube.com/@AndroidDevelopers)
- Subscribe to Medium Android Community.
- Read Documentation.
- Saving the best for the last: Try new APIs on your projects. You learn more by experimenting... Working on projects 

### Topics to learn before Applying for the first Job

Android Basics... 
- Layouts
- Android studio
- Android SDK and API version
- Storing data locally in an app
- Calling a rest API
- debugging
- Java/Kotlin... preferably Kotlin

### What do Interviewers look for in An Android Dev?
  
- Technical strengths: Coding best practices, implementation of Android libraries, test cases coverage, version control(Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket) 
  
- Cultural fitness: Team collaboration, good communication, honest feedback, conflict resolution.

### Resources to learn Compose

- [Jetpack Compose For Android Developers training resources](https://developer.android.com/courses/jetpack-compose/course)
- [Practical Jetpack Compose, Joe Birch](https://practicaljetpackcompose.com). 
Compose projects
- [Jetpack Compose Internals, Jorge Castillo](https://jorgecastillo.dev/book/).
- [Jetpack Compose and internals cohort course, Jorge Castillo](https://jorgecastillo.dev/course/)

### Which Architecture should I use in my app?
There exist several architecture patterns: MVP, MVVM, MVI, Redux and much more. Architecture patterns are guidelines for building quality apps. They are not cut-on-stone rules. 

All best practices can be applied to any architecture pattern. 

Nonetheless, architecture patterns are different: how they are implemented, the learning curve etc.  

Before adopting an architecture into your app, I'd recommend you first understand how it works. 

My recommendation: 
For beginners, I'd recommend starting with MVVM. It has a gentle learning curve, adopted in several Android projects and has many resources online. 

For Jetpack Compose projects, I'd recommend an MVI kind of approach. This helps a lot with handling state. And you can implement MVI on top of MVVM. 

### Compose vs XML
Jetpack Compose is the recommended modern UI toolkit for developing native Android UI. With Jetpack Compose, you build the UI faster with less code and intuitive Kotlin APIs. 

Do you have to know XML to learn to compose? No. For beginners, you'd get started with Compose straight away. But I think XML knowledge is good to have. XML is still dominant in legacy projects. Maintaining such projects requires one to know about XML. 

I'd advise working on first two or three projects using XML then jump to Compose. Knowledge about how Views/XML work will help you appreciate the progress and benefits of using Jetpack Compose in developing UI.

### Java or Kotlin

Kotlin is the first-class language for Android development. New Android development tools and content such as Jetpack libraries and training content are designed in Kotlin. For instance, Jetpack Compose, and Compiler plugins support na multiplatform projects. 

Therefore, if you're considering Android Development, I'd encourage learning Kotlin. 

Also, Kotlin is cross-platform. It can be used in Android development, server-side and Kotlin multi-platform. Check the docs for more: [Kotlin Docs](https://kotlinlang.org)

### What does an android developer do on a normal basis?(May Remove it)
- Design and develop Android apps, debugging and troubleshooting, staying current with Android OS, android developement updates, maintaining existing apps, Implement libraries

### Android Developer Interview
- Resume screening, 
- Recruiter, hiring manager call
- Screening done differently
 - Time boxed code  challenge, DSA
 - Technical screening call with a mobile Engineer
 - Take home assignment
- On site interview

### As a beginner in android development, when do I know it's the right time for me to start applying for a job?
Varies... 
- immediately after campus, complete a bootcamp. 
For self taught.. work on one or a number of projects to boost your portifolio. 

I do not think there is a specific time, but you do  not want to wait for soooo long. There is mo perfct time. 


### GDE Questions
What? 
Google Developer Experts is a global community of experienced developers who love to share their knowledge and passion with others.

Check the [docs](https://developers.google.com/community/experts) to learn about who can join and the application process. 

### Technical Writing
How do I get started? Why? What to write about? How to structure my articles

### Mentorship and Communities
Mentorship is a learning relationship between an experienced person and someone who wants to grow. With a healthy mentoring relationship, both parties gain, not just the mentee[Growing as a Mobile Engineer](https://www.mobileatscale.com/growing.html).

Mentees, do not ask, "Will you be my mentor?". If you ask the answer might be no. So shift your thinking from "If I get a mentor, I'll excel" to "If I excel, I will get a mentor". Mentorship relationships start with a mutual connection—and mentors often select protégés based on their performance and potential. [Lean In For Graduates](https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Graduates-Chapters-Including-Negotiate/dp/0385353677)

Start working on something, developing that project, writing that article etc. You'll find many people willing to help you once you've started. For instance, If you get stuck coz of a bug, reach out for help. There are numerous amazing developers in developer groups willing to help you. 

This is one of the ways to find mentors.
